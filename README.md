An SQL database is required to use this code. Setup the database credentials 
either with a .env file, or by creating environment variables
```bash
DB_HOST=db_host_name
DB_USER_NAME=db_user_name
DB_PASSWORD=db_password
```

This code doesn't do much right now, but I wanted to make it public anyway to 
show my work for job applications.
